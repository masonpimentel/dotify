# Dotify

Welcome!<br>

This is an application I built alongside 3 other team members: Jonathan Hansen, Scott Pidzarko and Alex Lin. 
The main purpose of this project was to become more familiar with serving an application with a relational database in the backend. 
We decided to use the Laravel PHP framework to implement the application API and MySQL for the database management system.<br>

This is a restructuring of the original repository https://github.com/snxfz947/DotifyPre to allow for hosting on Heroku.
[ClearDB](http://w2.cleardb.net/) is the MySQL cloud database service used, as a Heroku add-on.

Dotify is meant to provide a subset of the services provided by [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com). It is a small music 
management system in which users are able to create playlists from a library of albums and songs. 

There are two classes of users - administrators and users. Standard users have access to their own playlists,
and all the songs in the Dotify library. 

## Standard users

The following credentials can be used - username: Porchwork, password: 123333

Users are able to search for songs by song name or genre:

## Administrators

Administrators have access to the administrator console. The following credentials can be used - username: SnXfZ947, 
password: abcd123
