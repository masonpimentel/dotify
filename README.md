# Dotify

Welcome!<br>

This is an application I built alongside 3 other team members: Jonathan Hansen, Scott Pidzarko and Alex Lin. 
The main purpose of this project was to become more familiar with serving an application with a relational database in the backend. 
We decided to use the Laravel PHP framework to implement the application API and MySQL for the database management system.<br>

This is a restructuring of the original repository https://github.com/snxfz947/DotifyPre to allow for hosting on Heroku.

Dotify is meant to provide a subset of the services provided by [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com)
